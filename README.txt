100 C Loop Problems Challenge 🚀
Welcome to my personal programming challenge! I'm solving 100 problems using loops in C language to improve my logic, coding habits, and understanding of C syntax and control flow.

📌 Challenge Goal
Solve 100 problems that focus on loop structures (for, while, do-while) in C. The problems vary in difficulty and cover topics such as:

Basic Patterns & Counting
Number Processing
Patterns with Stars & Numbers
Series Problems
Advanced Math Loop Challenges
String Loop
Arrays Using Loops
Special Patterns with Number
Bitwise & Logic via Loops
Hard Problems
📁 Repository Structure
Each problem is saved as a separate .c file:

##🌱 Why I'm Doing This This challenge is my way of practicing and reinforcing what I've learned about loops and C programming. It helps build a habit of daily coding, enhances logical thinking, and prepares me for more complex algorithms and data structures.
